This is the very first edition, and I am still exploring ways to optimize these soltions. 

For example, the debugging process is still quite awkward and counter-intuitive. 
I am thinking of using the *Task.json* configuration file to automate this process. 

However, I haven't made any significant progress yet. 

If you find some better solutions, please share them so that everyone can benefit from it. 

Also, if you have any concerns or suggestions about the tutorial, you are more than welcomed to post them in the *Issues* page. 

Thanks!
